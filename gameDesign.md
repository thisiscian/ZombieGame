Zombie Game
===========

Made in Java

Turn Based/Real Time -- Not decided (leaning towards real time)

YouWishYouWereDeath
-------------------
	You can replay any level that you have died on, but the zombies are still at the evolution level they killed you on
	your old character is walking round as a zombie, and you have to kill him to get your stuff back
	the old character also hunts your resurrection down
	your old character has your death stats + the stats of whatever zombie killed him
	after some time, you-zombie gets added to genepool
		don't get killed by a boss is all I'll say
	'hardcore mode'

Weapons
-------
	**Melee Weapons**
		loads of them
		potentially have hack'n'slash style combos
			low combos lead to stronger zombies
			high combos lead to zombies gaining less points
			"zombos"
			some zombies will try to break your combo by avoiding you 
	**Guns**
		click on zombies for more points
		less points means better zombies
	Want to save new weapons for dire times

NPCs
----
	you REALLY need to save them to stop them becoming zombies
		they also have stats
	or you can kill them, but then your npc rep goes down, and they might start attacking you

Monsters (Zombies)
------------------
	'evolve' according to player's weaknesses
		yet to decide what determines fitness
			could be 'player is the predator' model or 'zombie is the predator' model
		genetic algorithms, perhaps
	loads and loads of traits
		some which unlock after specific events
		some which unlock randomly (due to evolution)
	have something like tactics, not just hard
	Boss: maxed out version of locally unusually high stat
		can pop up later as normal zombie
		bosses spawn on 'event'
	Zombie puberty - very new types of zombies can't breed for some time, you can stop something you've unleashed

Player Characters
----------------
	will have stats, levelling up stats
		zombies improve faster if you don't use your skill at a very high level
	maybe have realism, you might need to eat and shit
	more stats = harder zombies
	
Level
-----
	Be in a town/random generated dungeons -- Not decided
		towns, tower defence elements
	need to go towns for food maybe

Aim of game is to destroy source of infection (nethack style, nigh on impossible to finish)

multiplayer
-----------
	should be much the same
	multi/single player should be run on the same thing
	maybe threading
	can join into a game at any point
		might not be worth it
	maybe let people troll, maybe spawn people nearby so you can kill them yourself if you need 

Randomly generated excuse for zombies
	
Barrel jokes; final boss shits barrels
